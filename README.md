# KODAMA
Enhanced dimensionality reduction for high throughput omics data

## Overview 

KODAMA is an unsupervised and semi-supervised learning algorithm that performs feature extraction from noisy and high-dimensional data. It facilitates identification of patterns representing underlying groups on all samples in a data set. 

This is a version in developing of KODAMA with landmarks to adapt the algorithm to the analysis of data set with more than 10,000 entries. The wrapper for the C++ implementation of Barnes-Hut t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding has been integrated to convert the KODAMA's dissimilarity matrix in a low dimensional space. 

KODAMA was built on accuracy maximization algorithms described in detail in the following publication:
